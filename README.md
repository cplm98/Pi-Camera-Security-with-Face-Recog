# Pi-Camera-Security-with-Face-Recog
Remotely monitor your office for intruders using azure, AWS and twilio. Train a group of trusted faces, and check motion triggered photos against them. If the face is known a text with their name and photo will be sent to you. If the face is unknown all photos of the incident are uploaded and the last one is sent to you along with a warning of intruders.
